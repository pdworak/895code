Implementation Plan:

Goal: Use Python to count 1) number of lines, 2) words, and 3) characters in the Gutenberg.org version of Romeo and Julliet.  4) Make a catalog of words and count how many times they occur in the text.

Requirements: access file and analyze contents

High level plan:

Open file and analyze contents.  Parse text into distinct lines to do a line count. Parse lines into words and count words by line with incremental count for total words across all lines. Count characters by in each word with incremental count of all characters across all words in the document. Create empty dictionary and populate with unique words and values representing the number of times words occur in the document.

Detailed plan:

Goals 1 - 3:
Open the file to access text
Define count/increment and dictionary variables and set to 0.
Set up a line loop to go trough each line of text; increment line count
Split line into words; increment word count

Check whether the basic line loop works as intended and produces expected result; add a print command where the status of all variables after the specified iteration can be printed and evaluated.

Goal 4

Test a nested loop for each word in a line.  Create a "clean" version of the word by replacing special characters with "".  If new word, add to the dictionary, if repeated word increment its occurance counter.

Loop dictionary sorted by count and, for each word, print its occurance count.

Check the nested loop.

Merge the code into one and comit.
